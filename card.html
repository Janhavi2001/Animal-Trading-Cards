			<p id="info">The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a solitary hunter but a social species. It is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk. It secretes and perceives pheromones.</p>
